############ PART 1 ############
In file "utils1.py" the train, dev and test data is loaded. In a variable called "dir_name" we can choose what directory the data will come from: "pos" or "ner".
The neural network definition, train and prediction is in "tagger1.py". In variables called "train" and "test" can be specified whether the model will train / predict on test, respectively (boolean values).
Further more, the model's parameters can be loaded from / saved to a file. Variables "save_model" and "load_model" values can be True or False for either of those tasks, and the path to the load / save file is placed in a variable called "model_args_path".
The loading of the model is the first thing that will happen, if load_model is True. Then training (if train=True), and then the model can be saved (if save_model=True). Only then the model will predict on test (test=True).

To run, place tagger1.py, utils1.py and the pos and/or ner directories in the same place.
Then, specify in the code the wanted parameters (directory of data, train, test) and run tagger1.py.
If you wish to load the model params to a file, place it also with the above and change the appropriate variable in the code.
